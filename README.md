# Socially Aware Interactions

Inspiration: Dialogue Trainer software, Communicate!
- Dialogue is not self-made: players are unable to learn relevant communication skills
- Dialogue is predetermined: agent does not need to adapt to changes in the context
- Dialogue tree is very big: editor may have trouble managing the dialogue

Goal: use the social context to manage a dialogue between a user and an artificial agent, based on defined social practices and identities, norms, conventions and values, aiming to build flexible and robust dialogue management systems that take the human as a starting point and that are necessary to create a human-based user interface
